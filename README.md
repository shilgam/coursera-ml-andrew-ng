### Intro

1. Supervised Learning
    - Categories of Supervised learning problems:
        - Regression problem - to predict a continuous valued output.
        - Classification problem - to predict a discrete value.
    - "Support Vector Machine" algorithm - allows to deal with an infinite number of features.
1. Unsupervised Learning
    - Examples:
        - Clustering algorithm - to cluster the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
        - Cocktail party algorithm - to identify individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds.
    - Tool: Octave programming environment

### Model and Cost Function

1. Model Representation
    - What the overall process of supervised learning looks like?
        - Example: Linear regression algorithm
